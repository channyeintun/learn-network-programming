## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Linux Networking (2-3 weeks)
- Network namespaces, veth pairs, bridges
- Packet flow through kernel
- tcpdump mastery

### Phase 2: Go Network Programming (2-3 weeks)
- TCP/UDP sockets
- gopacket for packet parsing
- netlink for kernel communication

### Phase 3: eBPF Fundamentals (4-5 weeks) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
- eBPF architecture & verifier
- XDP programs
- Maps for state management
- cilium/ebpf library

### Phase 4: XDP Deep Dive (3-4 weeks)
- Header parsing & rewriting
- Load balancing algorithms
- Connection tracking

### Phase 5: Kubernetes Networking (4-5 weeks)
- CNI plugin development
- Service networking
- Network policies with eBPF

### Phase 6: Production Tool (5-6 weeks)
- Complete one major project
- Metrics, logging, testing
- Documentation

## Teaching Modules

| Module | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| OSI Model Deep Dive | `01-osi-model-deep-dive.md` | ✅ Ready |
| NAT and Routing | `02-nat-and-routing.md` | ✅ Ready |
| Connection Tracking | `03-connection-tracking.md` | ✅ Ready |
| iptables Mastery | `04-iptables-mastery.md` | ✅ Ready (foundation) |
| Go Networking | `05-go-networking.md` | ✅ Ready |
| eBPF Fundamentals | `06-ebpf-fundamentals.md` | ✅ NEW |
| Quick Reference | `07-quick-reference.md` | 🔄 Updating |

---

## Why This Path?

### Career Value

eBPF engineers are in **extremely high demand**:

- Meta, Google, CloudFlare, Netflix use eBPF
- Kubernetes networking is moving to eBPF (Cilium)
- Security tools use eBPF (Falco, Tetragon)
- Observability uses eBPF (Pixie, Grafana Beyla)

**Salary range**: $150K-$300K+ for senior eBPF engineers

### Your Advantage

As a frontend developer who masters eBPF:
- Build observability dashboards others can't
- Create developer-friendly CLIs and APIs
- Full-stack from kernel to UI is rare

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Main roadmap updated → `network-roadmap.md`
2. ✅ eBPF module created → `06-ebpf-fundamentals.md`
3. Continue with existing foundation modules
4. When ready for eBPF, start Module 6

---

## Recommended Starting Point

If you're comfortable with the networking basics from previous modules:

**Jump to Module 5 (Go Networking)** → Then **Module 6 (eBPF)**

If you need to reinforce fundamentals:

**Start with Module 1 (OSI Model)** → Progress through all modules
